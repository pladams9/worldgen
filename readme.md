#Worldgen

Primarily PHP-based web app that generates maps. Uses a randomizable seed and various settings to do so.

This was a project that I started as part of a game I was creating as part of a learning exercise. The game never got farther than this, but I was fairly proud of this.

Code needs to be cleaned up, and I would like to improve upon this tool.
